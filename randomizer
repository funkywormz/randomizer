//THIS IS MY CODE FOR THE RANDOM COMMANDS. for the const names (example, reply) you can call them whatever you want
//if you're going to use this code many times, i recommend short names that are specific to the command's use because you can't repeat the const names
//example: my consts for the hello command are hey and hello, question words one are question and answer, etc

 const example = [
	"here you put the things you want the bot to reply to", 
	"it can be several things!", 
	"but make sure it doesn't overlap with other commands",
	"for example if you have two different commands that reply to hello the bot will answer two things to one message",
	"also you don't have to but i like putting each one on a different line so it's easier to read"
	];
  
  const reply = [
	"and here goes the replies!",
	"here you get to go crazy go stupid",
	"the more the better",
	"otherwise the bot will probably stick to one response",
	"in my experience it'll usually use the longest response",
	"so for variety try to stick to similar lengths!"
	];

//here you shouldn't change anything except for example and reply, which are the const names. change them to whatever you wrote above
